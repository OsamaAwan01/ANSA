The main files are the pdfs, accompanying the course book

  Analytical Network and System Administration, by Mark Burgess
 
LectureNotes.pdf           - what I wrote on the blackboard, week by week
CourseExerciseWorkbook.pdf - a book from which weekly exercises were picked
CourseSolutions.pdf        - the solution guide

--------- FILES -----------------

Due to a git accident, the files had to be recovered from git lost and
found, where their names were erased.  In the future it might be
useful to access these source files, but probably not that useful, so
cross that bridge when we come to it.

This exercise booklet is written in old postscript text due to the eps figures. It could probably be converted
into PDFlatex now.

*.fig - xfig figures (export to eps or pdf)
*.eps - encapsulated postscript
